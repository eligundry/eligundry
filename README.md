### About

* I am a 🧑‍💻 full stack web engineer.
* I love to plan and 👨‍🍳 cook elaborate meals. It really activates the engineering part of my brain!
* I have a 🤓 non-traditional computer science education. I attended a vocational school in high school, taught myself web programming, bounced around colleges for computer science while working the entire time before deciding to go pro!
* I am a Vim user but I actively encourage everyone to use something else. Using Vim in 2023 is a cool bar trick.
* I currently live in 📍 Astoria, Queens. I didn't think I would settle down in Queens and love it as much as I do, but life is like that sometimes.
* I have a 😼 fat cat named Fonzie and I sorta have [a tattoo of him on my arm](https://twitter.com/EliGundry/status/1055933062125703168).

### Working With Me

- 🌞 My days start at 10am eastern and end at 6pm-ish. I get in the zone in the afternoon/evening.
- 👋 I'm completely fine with being distracted at any time. I'm really good at context switching and it actually gives me energy.
- 🌎 Tell me the context on why something should be done. I will "yes, and" whenever I can.
- 💼 Tell me the business case about what I'm working on, either now or in the near future. I will kick around and meditate on
  ideas that are sometimes good.
- 🐈‍⬛ I am intensely curious about how and why things work. If you wanna go deep on something we're talking about, I won't stop
  you, and I will probably do the same.
- 🔥 I can, at times, come in with a hot take when it's something I've been thinking a lot about.
- 🎵 I love new music recommendations and love to share if it's appreciated. [I have been scrobbling to Last.fm since 2009](https://www.last.fm/user/eli_pwnd).

### Building

💿 [Album Mode.party](https://album-mode.party/): Spotify kept recommending me music too similar to what I already liked so
I made an application that recommends me random albums using their search APIs and scraped reviews from various publications.
This is the first application I have made that _I_ use daily.

🥳 [eligundry.com](https://eligundry.com/): Personal sites are my version of a Zen Garden. They are also a great way to learn
how to use new frameworks relevant to my job.
